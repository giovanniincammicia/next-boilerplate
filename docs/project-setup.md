**Purpose**: Defines what you're building and why.
**Chat Mode**: `prd`
**Example Prompt**: Create a product requirements document for the project with these features: ...

**File**: `docs/tech.md`
**Purpose**: Details the technology stack and architecture.
**Chat Mode**: `agent`
**Example Prompt**: Create a technical specification for the project with these technologies: ... Feel free to add suggestions for the tech stack based on the project requirements.

### 3. Create Infrastructure Document

**File**: `docs/infrastructure.md`
**Purpose**: Outlines cloud services and deployment strategy.
**Chat Mode**: `architect`
**Example Prompt**: Create an infrastructure document with the following elements: ...

### 4. Create Implementation Plan

**File**: `docs/implementation-plan.md`
**Purpose**: Breaks down the development timeline and milestones.
**Chat Mode**: `implementation-plan`
**Example Prompt**: Create an implementation plan for the project based on all the files in the `docs/` directory.
